              <p>
                Early childhood years are the most important years in a child’s
                life. More than 80% of the brain develops in these years. They
                are called the foundation years and are responsible for shaping
                a child’s future.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each child is unique with different skills and abilities. A
                child succeeds most when areas of interest and natural ability
                are identified and encouraged early in life.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, how much do we learn about one of our most important
                responsibilities? How to be a good parent and raise a happy and
                successful child?
              </p>
              <p>
                Parents today are actively seeking guidance on dos and don’ts,
                suitable activities, learning aids, toys, and how to handle
                different situations. Boostmychild caters to all these parental
                needs and more.

                Boostmychild App helps parents raise their child better in the
                foundation years. It generates a child’s development profile in
                6 categories and 20+ development areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on this profile, customized recommendations are shared
                weekly throughout the year — including parenting guidelines,
                parent-child activities, worksheets, suitable hobby areas, and
                toolkits.

                A progress tracker maps the child’s development over the years,
                helping parents encourage and monitor their child’s growth while
                becoming better parents themselves.
